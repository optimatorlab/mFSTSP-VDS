# The multiple flying sidekicks traveling salesman problem with variable drone speeds (mFSTSP-VDS)

This repository provides a collection of mFSTSP-VDS test problems, as well as the soucre code of the heuristic to solve mFSTSP-VDS instances. The mFSTSP-VDS is a variant of the TSP in which multiple UAVs coordinate with a truck to deliver parcels in the minimum time, and UAVs can fly at any speeds below their maximum speeds.

The repository accompanies the following paper, which is currently under its second round of reviews:
> R. Raj and C. Murray. Fly slower, deliver faster: The multiple flying sidekicks traveling salesman problem with variable drone speeds. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3549622

The paper provides details on the mFSTSP-VDS definition, and a heuristic as a solution approach. The figure below is the visual representation of the solution of an mFSTSP-VDS instance:

## mFSTSP-VDS Repository Contents
This repository contains **test problems (and solutions)**, and the **source code required to run the mFSTSP-VDS solver**.  These elements are described in detail below.  

1. A collection of **test problems (and solutions)** that were used in the analysis described in the [mFSTSP-VDS paper](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3549622).

   1. [`problems_info.csv`](problems_info.csv) contains a summary of all 80 "base" test problems, including: 
      - `numCust`: Total number of customers. 
      - `LeftLon`, `LowerLat`, `RightLon`, `UpperLat`: Latitude/Longitude coordinates of the bounding region from which customer locations were generated.  These coordinates specify the SW and NE corners of a rectangle.
      - `widthOfRegion` and `heightOfRegion`: Sizes of the geographic region, available in both miles and meters.
      - `numCust5milesDepot`: Number of customers located within 5 miles (Euclidean distance) of the depot.
      - `numCust10milesDepot`: Number of customers located within 10 miles (Euclidean distance) of the depot.
   
      This file may be useful if you are looking for problems with certain properties (e.g., 50-customer problems). 
   
   2. [`performance_summary_archive.csv`](performance_summary_archive.csv) provides information about solutions generated for each test problem in the [mFSTSP-VDS paper](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3549622). See the ["Archived Problem Solutions"](#Archived-Problem-Solutions) section below for details on the contents of this file.
       
   3. The [`Problems`](Problems) directory contains 80 sub-directories (one for each "base" problem).  Each sub-directory contains the following groups of files:
      - There are 2 files that are required by the solver.  These 2 files must be present in order to run the solver, as they are **inputs** to the heuristic:
         - `tbl_locations.csv` describes all nodes in the problem.  `nodeType 0` represents the depot, `nodeType 1` represents a customer.  The depot is always assigned to `nodeID 0`.  Each node has a corresponding latitude and longitude (specified in degrees).  The altitude is always 0.  Customer nodes have a corresponding non-zero parcel weight (in [pounds]).  There is no parcel associated with the depot. 
         - `tbl_truck_travel_data_PG.csv` contains the directed truck travel time and distance information from one node to another.  All time and distance values were obtained by pgRouting, using OpenStreetMaps data.
      - There is one map file:
         - `map.html` is a webpage showing the locations of all nodes (one depot and multiple customers) associated with this problem.  This is for informational purposes only; it is neither an input to, nor an output from, the solvers.
      - Finally, there are multiple files that were generated by the solvers when we were preparing the [mFSTSP-VDS paper](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3549622). These are **outputs** from the solver (and are, therefore, not required *before* solving a problem).  
         - Numerous files of the form `tbl_solutions_<UAVtype>_<# of UAVs>_<UAVSpeedType>.csv`, where 
            - `<UAVtype>` indicates the maximum allowable speeds of the UAVs.  This will be `101`, `102`, `103`, or `104`.  See below for more information.
            - `<# of UAVs>` indicates the number of available UAVs.  The [mFSTSP-VDS paper](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3549622) considered 1-4 UAVs.
            - `<UAVSpeedType>` will be either `maximum` (if UAV speeds were fixed to their maximum allowable values, as in mFSTSP), or `maximum-range` (if UAV speeds were fixed to their maximum-range values), or `variable` (if UAV speeds were variable, as in mFSTSP-VDS).
            
            Each of these files contains details about solutions corresponding to a specified combination of `<UAVtype>`, `<# of UAVs>`, and `<UAVSpeedType>`.
         
   4. The `Problems` directory also contains four CSV files, of the form `tbl_vehicles_<ID>.csv` that provide information on UAV specifications, where:
      - ID [`101`](Problems/tbl_vehicles_101.csv): Maximum UAV speed is 10 m/s;
      - ID [`102`](Problems/tbl_vehicles_102.csv): Maximum UAV speed is 20 m/s;
      - ID [`103`](Problems/tbl_vehicles_103.csv): Maximum UAV speed is 30 m/s; and
      - ID [`104`](Problems/tbl_vehicles_104.csv): Maximum UAV speed is 40 m/s.

      Each test problem can be solved with any of these UAV specifications by specifying the appropriate command-line argument.  This is described in the "[Running the Solvers](#Running-the-Solvers)" section below.

2. Although there are numerous Python scripts in this repository, [`main.py`](main.py) is the only one you will directly interact with.  This script makes use of the other Python scripts.  See "[Running the Solvers](#Running-the-Solvers)" below for instructions on generating solutions.

## Installation and Setup

This section provides instructions for running the mFSTSP-VDS solver.

### Compatability

The mFSTSP-VDS source code is compatible with both **Python 2** and **Python 3**.  
It has been tested on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Mac**.

### Prerequisites
- The heuristic requires [Gurobi](http://gurobi.com) as the MILP solver.
- The `pandas` Python package is also required.

- For **Linux/Mac**, issue the following terminal command to install `pandas`:
   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```
   *If you receive errors related to "access denied", try running `sudo pip install pandas`.*

- For **Windows**, there are two options:
   1. If you installed Python through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), `pandas` is already included.
   2. Otherwise, enter the following at a command prompt:
      ```
      py -m pip install pandas
      ```

### Download Problems and Source Code

There are two options for importing this repository's contents to your computer.
1. Download a .zip archive of the repository by either:
   - [Clicking this link](https://github.com/optimatorlab/mFSTSP-VDS/archive/master.zip), or
   - Clicking the green "Code" button above and choosing "Download ZIP". 
   
   In either case, unzip the archive on your computer to the location of your choice.

2. Use `git` from the command-line.
   1. Change directories to your preferred download location, replacing `<the directory of your choice>` with a path to that location:
   ```
   cd <the directory of your choice>   
   ```
   2. Clone the repository.  This will create a directory named `mFSTSP-VDS`.  Within that directory will be the entire contents of this repository.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/optimatorlab/mFSTSP-VDS.git
   ```
  
### Running the Solver



1. Open a terminal (command prompt) window.

2. Change directories to the location where the `mFSTSP-VDS` directory is saved.
   - For **Linux/Mac**:  We will assume that you have downloaded the repository to a directory named `mFSTSP-VDS` within your `Downloads` directory.  If you saved the `mFSTSP-VDS` directory elsewhere, you'll need to modify the paths below accordingly.
      ```
      cd ~/Downloads/mFSTSP-VDS
      ```
   
      *(Your path will differ if you saved the repository contents to a different directory.)*
      
   - For **Windows**:  We will assume that you have downloaded the repository to a folder named `mFSTSP-VDS` on the "D:\" drive.  If you saved the `mFSTSP-VDS` directory elsewhere, you'll need to modify the paths below accordingly.
      ```
      D:
      cd mFSTSP-VDS
      ```

      *(Your path will differ if you saved the repository contents to a different directory.)*
   
3. The mFSTSP solvers are invoked by running the [`main.py`](main.py) Python script with 5 arguments.  This will have the following structure:
   ```
   python main.py <problemName> <vehicleFileID> <UAVSpeedType> <numUAVs> <numTrucks>
   ```

   The command-line arguments, which must be specified in this order, are:
   - `problemName` - The name of the directory containing the data for a particular problem instance.  This directory is in the format of a timestamp, and must exist within the [`Problems`](Problems) directory.
   - `vehicleFileID` - Indicates the maximum allowable speed of the UAVs.  See the [note above](#mFSTSP-Repository-Contents), which describes the definitions of `101`, `102`, `103`, and `104`.
   - `UAVSpeedType` - Indicates the type of UAV speed being considered in the problem. `1` indicates that the problem is being solved by considering variable UAV speeds, `2` indicates that the problem is being solved by considering UAV speeds equal to the maximum allowable speed, and `3` indicates that the problem is being solved by considering UAV speeds equal to the maximum-range speeds.
   - `numUAVs` - Number of UAVs available in the problem (e.g., `3`).
   - `numTrucks` - Number of trucks available in the problem.  The code currently only supports `1` truck. Assigning `-1` to this argument ignores its value and considers 1 truck.
   
   **Example 1 -- Solving the problem with variable UAV speeds (mFSTSP-VDS):**
   
   ```
   python main.py 20191118T124843195400 101 1 3 -1
   ```

   **Example 2 -- Solving the problem with maximum UAV speeds (mFSTSP):**

   ```
   python main.py 20191118T124843195400 101 2 3 -1
   ```
   
4. The solver is finished when you receive a message like this in the terminal:
   ```
   See 'performance_summary.csv' for statistics.

   See 'Problems/20191118T124843195400/tbl_solutions_101_3_variable.csv' for solution summary.
   ```

   - The solver appends a row to the end of [`performance_summary.csv`](performance_summary.csv).  This row contains the objective function value, total run time, number of customers assigned to the truck, number of customers assigned to UAVs, etc.

   - The solver also generates a file of the form `tbl_solutions_<UAVtype>_<# of UAVs>_<UAVSpeedType>.csv`.  This file will appear within the subdirectory corresponding to the `problemName` within the [`Problems`](Problems) directory (e.g.,  [`Problems/20191118T124843195400`](Problems/20191118T124843195400)) in the above example.  The solutions file contains the objective function value and a detailed schedule for the truck and UAV(s).
      - **NOTE**: If you re-run the solver, solution details will be appended to the bottom of the applicable `tbl_solutions_<UAVtype>_<# of UAVs>_<UAVSpeedType>.csv` file.

## Archived Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the problem instances, as discussed in the analysis section of the [mFSTSP-VDS paper](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3549622). 

[`performance_summary_archive.csv`](performance_summary_archive.csv) provides summary information about these solutions. 
This file contains the following columns:
- `problemName` - The name of the problem instance (written in the form of a timestamp).  This is a subdirectory name within the [`Problems`](Problems) directory.
- `vehicleFileID` - Indicates the maximum speed of the UAVs (or the `tbl_vehicles_<ID>.csv` file that was used)
- `numUAVs` - # of UAVs available (`1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`).
- `UAVSpeedType` - Indicates whether the problem was solved using `maximum`, `maximum-range` or `variable` UAV speeds.
- `numTrucks` - This can be ignored; it will always have a value of `-1`.  However, in each problem there is actually exactly 1 truck.
- `numCustomers` - The total number of customers.
- `timestamp` - The time at which the problem was solved.
- `ofv` - The objective function value, as obtained by the given solution approach.
- `totalTime` - The total runtime of the heuristic.
- `numUAVcust` - The number of customers assigned to the UAV(s).
- `numTruckCust` - The number of customers assigned to the truck.
- `waitingTruck` - The amount of time, in [seconds], that the truck spends waiting on UAVs.
- `waitingUAV` - The amount of time, in [seconds], that the UAVs spend waiting on the truck.

[`performance_summary_archive.csv`](performance_summary_archive.csv) contains records for the following classes of problems:
Each problem (there are 80 total) was run using four different settings of `vehicleFileID` (101, 102, 103, and 104) and four different settings of `numUAVs` (1, 2, 3, and 4).  Each problem was solved using the maximum, the maximum-range, and the variable UAV speeds.  This resulted in a total of 3840 problem solutions (80 * 4 * 4 * 3).
    
Details of each solution may be found in the applicable `tbl_solutions_<UAVtype>_<# of UAVs>_<UAVSpeedType>.csv` file contained within the `problemName` subdirectory of the [`Problems`](Problems) directory (e.g., [`Problems/20191118T124843195400`](Problems/20191118T124843195400)).

When a problem is run again, using the same settings (e.g., the same `vehicleFileID`, `numUAVs` and `UAVSpeedType`), the solution details are appended to the applicable `tbl_solutions_<UAVtype>_<# of UAVs>_<UAVSpeedType>.csv` file.
